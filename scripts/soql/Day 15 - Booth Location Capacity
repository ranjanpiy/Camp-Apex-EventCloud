public class CampApexSolution {
    public List<AggregateResult> getBoothCapacity() {
        // Your SOQL query here
        List<AggregateResult> solution =[SELECT Location__c loc, SUM(Daily_Capacity__c)cap
            FROM Booth__c 
            GROUP BY Location__c];
    return solution;
    }
}

/*Now they need your help analyzing booth allocations across different locations. Each booth has a daily visitor capacity, and we need to understand the total capacity per location to properly distribute security staff and plan for crowd control.


Your task is to write a SOQL query that groups booths by location and calculates the total daily capacity for each location. This will help ensure we're not overloading any particular area of the festival.


Available Data

The Booth__c object contains the following fields:


Field Name	Type	Description
Location__c	Picklist	Booth location (Main Square, Treat Lane, Sweet Corner, Festival Row)
Daily_Capacity__c	Number	Maximum number of visitors per day

Requirements

Complete the getBoothCapacity() method in the CampApexSolution class that returns booth capacity data grouped by location:


public class CampApexSolution {
    public List<AggregateResult> getBoothCapacity() {
        // Your SOQL query here
    }
}

Your query should:

Group booths by their location
Calculate the sum of daily capacity for each location
Use the alias 'loc' for Location__c
Use the alias 'cap' for the SUM of Daily_Capacity__c

Sample Data

Booth Number	Location	Daily Capacity
BOOTH-0001	Main Square	100
BOOTH-0002	Main Square	150
BOOTH-0003	Treat Lane	75

Expected Results:


Location (loc)	Total Capacity (cap)
Main Square	250
Treat Lane	75

Note: The test cases will handle various scenarios including multiple booths per location, empty capacity values, and different location distributions.
