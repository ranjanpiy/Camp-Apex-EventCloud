/*Oh no! Because the automation was turned off - our approvers didn't review and approve the permits in time! Here's what we have seen:


Approved permits that are missing their review dates (this could indicate a process was skipped)
Permits where the review date has already passed but the permit is still in an early stage (marked as new, under review, or has no status set)

Write a query to help the organizers identify these permits so they can ensure proper processing.



Requirements:
Complete the getPermitsNeedingReview() method in the CampApexSolution class:


public class CampApexSolution {
    public List<Permit__c> getPermitsNeedingReview() {
        // Your SOQL query here
    }
}

Your query should:

Find permits that match either of these conditions:
Permits that have been approved but don't have a review date recorded
Permits with a review date in the past that are either new, under review, or missing a status
Order the results by when they were created, with the newest first
Return all fields



Sample Data



Permit__c:

Name	Status__c	Review_Date__c	CreatedDate
P-0001	Approved	NULL	2024-01-15
P-0002	Under Review	2023-12-31	2024-01-10
P-0003	Approved	2024-12-31	2024-01-05
P-0004	NULL	2023-12-01	2024-01-01

Expected Results:

Name	Status__c	Review_Date__c
P-0001	Approved	NULL
P-0002	Under Review	2023-12-31
P-0004	NULL	2023-12-01

Note: The test cases will verify the logic works across different scenarios and that results are properly ordered.
