public class CampApexSolution {

        List<AggregateResult> solution =[ SELECT Booth_Type__c type, Festival_Booth__r.Location__c loc, COUNT(Id)cnt  FROM Permit__c
        WHERE Festival_Booth__r.Status__c ='Operating'

/*The festival organizers need to analyze booth type distributions across different locations to ensure a balanced variety of offerings. Your task is to help them identify areas that might have too many similar booths clustered together.


Write a SOQL query that analyzes the concentration of booth types in each location. This will help ensure diverse offerings throughout the festival grounds.


Requirements

Complete the getBoothTypesByLocation() method in the CampApexSolution class that returns booth type concentration data:


public class CampApexSolution {
    public List<AggregateResult> getBoothTypesByLocation() {
        // Your SOQL query here
    }
}

Your query should:

Group by both Location and Booth Type
Count the number of booths for each combination
Only include booths with Status = 'Operating'
Use alias 'loc' for Location__c
Use alias 'type' for Booth_Type__c
Use alias 'cnt' for the COUNT
Order by count descending

Sample Data

Permit__c:

ID	Booth_Type__c	Booth__c (lookup to Booth)
P1	Food	B1
P2	Food	B2
P3	Sweets	B3

Booth__c:

ID	Location__c	Status
B1	Main Square	Operating
B2	Main Square	Operating
B3	Treat Lane	Operating



Expected Results:

Location (loc)	Booth Type (type)	Count (cnt)
Main Square	Food	2
Treat Lane	Sweets	1

Note: The test cases will verify correct grouping, counting, and ordering of results across various scenarios.
