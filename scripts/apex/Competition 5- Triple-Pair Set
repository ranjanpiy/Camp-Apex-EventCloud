Triple -pair Set
You're given four playing cards, each showing a number from 1 to 13. Your task is to determine if it's possible to create a special combination by adding exactly one more card.


This combination, known as a "Triple-Pair Set," requires:


Three cards showing the same number
Two cards showing a different but matching number


Constraints
Input will be a List of 4 integers
Input numbers must be between 1 and 13 (inclusive)
The order of numbers doesn't matter



Task
Write a method that returns:

true if a Triple-Pair Set can be formed by adding one card
false if it's impossible

Examples

Example 1
Input: 3 3 3 7
Output: true
Explanation: Adding a 7 would create three 3s and two 7s.




Example 2
Input: 4 5 6 7
Output: false
Explanation: No single card addition can create three matching cards and a pair.




Example 3
Input: 2 2 9 9
Output: true
Explanation: Adding either a 2 or a 9 would complete the pattern.




Important Notes
Five cards showing the same number do not count as a valid Triple-Pair Set
The order of input numbers doesn't matter
Each card must be used in forming the combination
