/*Confectioner Caramel is preparing for the Gingerbread Village Annual Candy Competition! She has a special recipe that requires combining exactly two different types of candy ingredients. However, each ingredient has a specific sweetness level, and she needs to ensure the combinations meet her criteria.


Given a list of integers representing the sweetness level of each candy ingredient and a target difference value, help Confectioner Caramel find how many valid combinations she can make! A valid combination is formed by picking two different ingredients where their sweetness levels differ by exactly the target value.


Return the total number of valid combinations possible.


Example 1:
Input: candyLevels = [1, 4, 5, 7], targetDiff = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- Valid combinations are:
  * 1 and 4 (difference of 3)
  * 4 and 7 (difference of 3)
- 5 and 7 don't work (difference of 2)
- 1 and 7 don't work (difference of 6)
Example 2:
Input: candyLevels = [2, 2, 2, 2], targetDiff = 0
Output: 0
Explanation:
- All ingredients have same sweetness
- No combination has the required difference
Example 3:
Input: candyLevels = [1, 3, 5], targetDiff = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Valid combinations are:
  * 1 and 3 (difference of 2)
  * 3 and 5 (difference of 2)



Constraints
The list will contain between 2 and 100 ingredients
Each sweetness level will be between 1 and 1000
The target difference will be between 0 and 1000
The input list will never be null
