/*Master Baker Maple needs help with the eggnog station. The festival organizers need to know exactly how many servings of eggnog they can make with their current ingredients.

According to the ancient recipe book, each serving of eggnog requires:

2 cups of milk
1 cup of heavy cream
3 eggs
1/4 cup of sugar
A pinch of nutmeg (we don't need to calculate this)



Challenge
Create an Apex method that calculates the maximum number of complete eggnog servings that can be made given the available ingredients. You must use ALL ingredients in the same proportion - no partial servings allowed!




Example 1
Input: milk = 4, cream = 2, eggs = 6, sugar = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: We can make exactly 2 servings because:

4 cups milk รท 2 cups per serving = 2 servings
2 cups cream รท 1 cup per serving = 2 servings
6 eggs รท 3 eggs per serving = 2 servings
1 cup sugar รท 0.25 cups per serving = 4 servings (but limited by other ingredients)

Example 2
Input: milk = 2, cream = 1, eggs = 2, sugar = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: We need at least 3 eggs per serving, so no complete servings can be made.


Example 3
Input: milk = 10, cream = 5, eggs = 15, sugar = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: We can make 5 complete servings with these ingredients.


Constraints
All input numbers will be non-negative integers
Input numbers will not exceed 1000
Focus on calculating complete servings only */
