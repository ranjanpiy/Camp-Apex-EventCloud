/*Welcome to the Gingerbread Village, your first task awaits! We'll give you something urgent but straightforward to start.


As the newly appointed Village Counter, you have an important task: finding the average number of gingerbread houses in the village.


Mayor Snickerdoodle approaches you with a clipboard. "Hello there! We need your help to count our gingerbread houses. Each street in our village has a different number of houses, and we need to know the average number of houses per street."


The Mayor hands you the clipboard with a list of numbers. Each number represents the count of gingerbread houses on a street. For example:


[ 5, 10, 3, 7, 8]

In this small example, there are 5 streets:

 - The first street has 5 houses
 - The second street has 10 houses
 - The third street has 3 houses
 - The fourth street has 7 houses
 - The fifth street has 8 houses

To find the average number of houses in per street, you simply need to add up all these numbers:

5 + 10 + 3 + 7 + 8 = 33


and divide by the total number of streets, in this case 5. The average number of houses per street is:


33 / 5 = 6.6


Make sense? Oh! One thing. If we hand you an invalid list, just return 0. A list is invalid when it's blank or null.


Let's put your skills to the test!
