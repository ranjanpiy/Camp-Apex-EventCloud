/* Preparations for the festival in Gingerbread Village are in full swing, and excitement fills the frosty air as villagers prepare for the much-loved Ice Sculpture Contest. This year, to add a whimsical twist, the event’s coordinator, Hannah Frostwhistle, has decided that each sculpture’s entry name must be a palindrome—a word or phrase that reads the same forward and backward.


The participants have submitted their names, but Hannah needs help verifying that each one truly is a palindrome before they can be officially entered. Your task is to review each entry name, check for true symmetry, and confirm it as a palindrome so Hannah can complete the registration process. Let’s ensure the contest entries meet the mark for this enchanting winter festival challenge!


Implement the method, isPalindrome that takes a string as input and returns a boolean if the input string is a palindrome. Ignore any spaces and puncuation in the input string. The input string will never be null.


Example 1
Input: 'Yo, Banana Boy!'
Output: true

Example 2
Input: 'Starburst rubs rats.'
Output: false

Example 3
Input: 'Eva, can I see bees in a cave?'
Output: true
