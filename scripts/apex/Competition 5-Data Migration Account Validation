Data Migration Account Validation

20
Your organization has previously performed a data migration project. During the project, some incomplete data was brought into the system. Until that data is restored some workarounds need to be added to the system.


You're asked to build a method that can filter out "invalid" account records.


Any Account is automatically valid if it does not contain "DATA_MIGRATION" in the name.


Any Account with "DATA_MIGRATION" in its name must satisfy the following criteria to be valid:

Must have a billing address (BillingStreet and BillingCity)
Must have a website URL that starts with "https://"

Task:
Return a list of all the valid account records.


Notes:
Your solution must handle both single record and bulk operations
